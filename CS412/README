To run the code:
Input:
n m (where n is the number of variables(1 to n) and m is the number of clauses)
1 2 3 (This is the clause format with one space between variables)
1 -2 3 (The character '-' is used to )

Output:
# of satisfied clauses
Var: T or F (assignment)

To run test code run the command:
sh run_test_cases_approx.sh or sh run_test_cases_exact.sh
Cases 1,2, and 3 will run and complete 
while case 4 needs to be commented back into to run.
Case 4 takes over 20 min to complete and may be stopped by pressing CTRL + C for the exact solution (will run fine for approx)

Test cases are the cases#

Python code exact solution is in exact_solution.py
Python code approx solution is in approx_solution.py
